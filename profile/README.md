# IGISTDM

## Description

We are a team of students from NTOU. This organization stores everything about our graduation project - [Image-Guided Image Style Transfer with Diffusion model](https://github.com/IGISTDM/docs/raw/master/report.pdf)

## Repos

### Main contribution

1. [IGISTDM](https://github.com/IGISTDM/IGISTDM)
    - Contains code about how we do image style transfer
2. [docs](https://github.com/IGISTDM/docs)
    - Contains report and poster of our method

### Experiment

#### Dataset

1. [image_downloader](https://github.com/IGISTDM/image_downloader)
    - Download script
2. [experiment](https://github.com/IGISTDM/experiment)
    - Content images and style images download via download script

#### Other methods

Modifications to fit our experiment

1. [pytorch-AdaIN](https://github.com/IGISTDM/pytorch-AdaIN)
2. [arbitrary_image_stylization](https://github.com/IGISTDM/magenta/tree/main/magenta/models/arbitrary_image_stylization)

#### Result

1. [results](https://github.com/IGISTDM/results)
    - Contains all the stylized images in our experiment and the loss data
2. [result_website](https://github.com/IGISTDM/result_website)
    - Visualize the results into a website

#### Analysis

- [style_loss_calculation](https://github.com/IGISTDM/style_loss_calculation)
  - Using clip score and gram matrix to calculate style loss
